of 2 ATPs after one reaction $$ \\rm 2\\ ATP+1\\ Glucose \\rightarrow 2\\ Pyruvate +4\\ ATP $$ Occurs in the cytoplasm and release ATP without oxygen ATP is produced by substrate level phosphorylation (direct enzymatic transfer of a phosphate to ADP) PFK ( phosphofructokinase ) is an allosteric enzyme that limit the concentration of ATP Citric acid cycle (Kerbs cycle) Occurs in the matrix of mitochondria and needs oxygen Each glucose (glycolysis reaction) would turn the reaction twice In the first step, acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetic acid (OAA or oxaloacetate) to produce citric acid, hence, the name citric acid cycle. Before it enters the Krebs cycle, pyruvate must first combine with coenzyme A (a vitamin) to form acetyl-CoA , which does enter the Krebs cycle. The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA produces 2 molecules of NADH , 1 NADH for each pyruvate. Each turn of the Krebs cycle releases 3 NADH, 1 ATP, 1 FADH , and the waste product CO2 , which is exhaled. During the Krebs cycle, ATP is produced by substrate level phosphorylation . Very little energy is released this way compared with the amount produced by oxidative phosphorylation. Kerbs Cycle NAD$^+$ and FAD NAD and FAD are required for normal cell respiration. NAD$^+$ ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ) and FAD ( flavin adenine dinucleotide ) are coenzymes that carry protons or electrons from glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to the electron transport chain. The enzyme NAD dehydrogenase or FAD dehydrogenase facilitates the transfer of hydrogen atoms from a substrate, such as glucose, to its coenzyme NAD$^+$. Without NAD$^+$ to accept protons and electrons from glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, both processes would cease and the cell would die. NAD and FAD are vitamin derivatives. NAD$^+$ is the oxidized form. NAD$\\rm _{re}$ or NADH is the reduced form. NADH carries 1 proton and 2 electrons. FAD is the oxidized form. FAD$\\rm _{re}$ or FADH$_2$ is the reduced form. ETC (Electron transport chain) ETC is a (series of) proton pump embedded in the mitochondria\u2019s cristae membrane that couples a exergonic reaction and an endergonic reaction, which pumps proton out, establish a proton gradient , and ATP production during chemiosmosis . There are thousands of copies of the ETC in every mitochondrion due to the extensive folding of the cristae membrane. The ETC carries electrons delivered by NADH and FADH$_2$ from glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to oxygen, the final electron acceptor , through a series of redox reactions . The highly electronegative oxygen pulls electrons through the electron transport chain. Electrons lose PE as they \u201cfall down\u201d the ETC toward oxygen. NADH ****delivers its electrons to a higher energy level in the chain than does FADH$_2$. As a result, NADH provides more energy for ATP synthesis than does FADH$_2$. Theoretically, each NADH produces 3 ATP molecules, while each FADH2 produces 2 ATP molecules. The ETC consists mostly of cytochromes . These are proteins structurally similar to hemoglobin. Cytochromes are present in all aerobes and are used to trace evolutionary relationships. One component of the ETC is labeled Q, which stands for ubiquinone , or alternately coenzyme Q . Q is a mobile electron carrier . It diffuses within and along the membrane. If the cristae membrane were not fluid, Q could not move through it, and the ETC could not operate. This phenomenon is a great example of how the structure of a fluid membrane relates to its function . The exergonic flow of electrons toward the highly electronegative oxygen provides the energy for the endergonic pumping of protons from the inner matrix to the outer compartment to create a gradient. Oxidative phosphorylation This energy-coupling mechanism , named chemiosmosis , uses the proton gradient to phosphorylate ADP to ATP Energy flow $$ \\rm {\\bf Glucose\\rightarrow NAD_{re}}\\ and\\

Theoretically, each NADH produces 3 ATP molecules, while each FADH2 produces 2 ATP molecules. The ETC consists mostly of cytochromes . These are proteins structurally similar to hemoglobin. Cytochromes are present in all aerobes and are used to trace evolutionary relationships. One component of the ETC is labeled Q, which stands for ubiquinone , or alternately coenzyme Q . Q is a mobile electron carrier . It diffuses within and along the membrane. If the cristae membrane were not fluid, Q could not move through it, and the ETC could not operate.
